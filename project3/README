TO RUN THE APPLICATIONS:
- First need to set the needed environment variables for Spark by running:
  `source ~/run.sh`
- Start Spark by running:
  `start_spark`
- To run an application:
  `~/grader_assign3/part-b/file-name.sh`

LOGIC OF THE APPLICATIONS:
- App 1 - Q1:
  + First we initialize the graph by using `GraphLoader.edgeListFile` to load the soc-LiveJournal1 file.
  + We then use the page rank algorithm implemented using GraphX
